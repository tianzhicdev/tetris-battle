A player who ignores abilities and saves for 2 minutes would have ~220 passive + 100 starting + ~400 earned = ~720 total, but the 300 cap means they'd overflow. This forces active spending — sitting on resources is punished, just like leaking elixir in Clash Royale.

Clash Royale's 1 elixir/2.8s serves the same purpose. Without passive regen, a player who falls behind in line clearing also falls behind in ability economy, creating a snowball effect that makes games feel hopeless."

Each sink removes 2 bottom rows and shifts the board down. Over 12 seconds: 3 sinks × 2 rows = 6 rows removed from the bottom. Opponent can counter by keeping bottom rows clean (so sinking empty rows is painless) or by racing to clear rows before they sink. Creates urgency.",
      "implementation": "Every 4 seconds for 12 seconds: remove the bottom 2 rows of opponent's board. Shift all remaining rows down by 2. Show sand/sinking VFX on bottom rows ~1 second before each sink as warning. 3 total sinks."
