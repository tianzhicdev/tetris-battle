# Tetris PvP — Progression System

---

## Two-Currency Economy

| Currency | Symbol | Scope | Earned By | Spent On |
|----------|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Stars** | ⭐ | In-match only, resets every game | Clearing lines, combos, T-spins during a match | Activating abilities mid-game |
| **Coins** | 🪙 | Persistent, carries across matches | Post-match rewards, milestones, daily quests | Unlocking abilities, cosmetics, themes |

Stars and Coins are completely separate. Stars are tactical (spend wisely mid-game). Coins are strategic (spend wisely between games).

---

## How Stars Are Earned (In-Match)

Stars fuel your abilities during a game. Earn them by playing well.

| Action | Stars Earned |
|--------|-------------|
| Single line clear | 10 ⭐ |
| Double line clear | 25 ⭐ |
| Triple line clear | 45 ⭐ |
| Tetris (4 lines) | 80 ⭐ |
| T-Spin single | 30 ⭐ |
| T-Spin double | 60 ⭐ |
| T-Spin triple | 100 ⭐ |
| Combo (2x) | +5 ⭐ bonus |
| Combo (3x) | +10 ⭐ bonus |
| Combo (4x+) | +20 ⭐ bonus |
| Perfect Clear (empty board) | 120 ⭐ |
| Surviving 60 seconds | 15 ⭐ (passive drip) |

With **Cascade Multiplier** active, all of the above are doubled.

A typical 3-minute match earns roughly 200–400 ⭐ for an average player, 500–800 ⭐ for a skilled one. This means average players can fire off 4–8 cheap abilities per game, while skilled players can afford 2–3 Ultra abilities or a constant stream of attacks.

---

## How Coins Are Earned (Post-Match)

Coins accumulate over time. This is the long-term progression fuel.

## Player Levels & XP

Separate from Elo (which measures skill), **Player Level** measures playtime and unlocks content.

| Action | XP Earned |
|--------|-----------|
| Complete a match (win or loss) | 100 XP |
| Win a match | +50 XP bonus |
| Complete a daily quest | 75 XP |
| Complete weekly challenge | 300 XP |

### XP Required Per Level

| Level Range | XP Per Level | Cumulative Matches (approx) |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| 1–5 | 300 XP | ~10–15 matches |
| 6–10 | 500 XP | ~30–40 matches |
| 11–15 | 750 XP | ~60–80 matches |
| 16–20 | 1,000 XP | ~100–130 matches |
| 21–25 | 1,500 XP | ~160–210 matches |
| 26–30 | 2,000 XP | ~240–320 matches |

A casual player reaches Level 25 in roughly 6–8 weeks. This feels right — Ultra abilities should take real investment to access.

## Ability Upgrade System (Optional — Adds Depth)

Each ability can be upgraded 3 times with coins. Upgrades are small but meaningful.

| Upgrade Level | Cost | Effect |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Level 2 | 200 🪙 | -10% star cost OR +2s duration |
| Level 3 | 500 🪙 | -15% star cost OR +4s duration OR -3s cooldown |
| Level 4 (Max) | 1,000 🪙 | -20% star cost OR +6s duration OR +secondary effect |

**Example upgrades:**
- Screen Shake Lv4: costs 20⭐ instead of 25⭐, lasts 14s instead of 10s
- Cross FireBomb Lv4: costs 36⭐ instead of 45⭐, clears 4 rows/columns instead of 3
- Deflect Shield Lv4: costs 40⭐ instead of 50⭐, blocks next 2 debuffs instead of 1

This is optional complexity — skip it for MVP and add it later as a retention feature when you see players maxing out their unlocks.

## Matchmaking Consideration

Players should only be matched against opponents at the same Stage or ±1 Stage. A Level 3 Rookie with 3 abilities should never face a Level 22 Master with 6 abilities including Board Swap. Elo handles skill, but Stage gates handle power level.

| Your Stage | Can Match Against |
|------------|-------------------|
| Rookie (1–5) | Rookie only |
| Contender (6–10) | Rookie, Contender |
| Challenger (11–15) | Contender, Challenger |
| Veteran (16–20) | Challenger, Veteran |
| Master (21–25) | Veteran, Master, Legend |
| Legend (26+) | Master, Legend |

## Monetization Hooks (Future — Not MVP)

These are natural places to add IAP later without making the game pay-to-win:

- **Coin doublers** — "Double coins for 24 hours" ($1.99)
- **Theme packs** — cosmetic only, no gameplay advantage ($2.99–$4.99)
- **Battle Pass** — seasonal track with free + premium cosmetic rewards ($4.99/season)
- **Ability fast-unlock** — buy coins to skip the grind, but never skip the level gate

**Critical rule:** Never sell abilities directly. Never sell star boosts. Never let paying players have abilities that free players can't eventually earn. The level gate ensures everyone progresses through the same skill curve.
